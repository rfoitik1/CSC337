# CSC337
Web Programming at University of Arizona

The 'Quotations' project was the final project of the CSC337 class in which myself and a partner were tasked with creating a website that would allow visitors to create an account which would securely store their data in our hashed database.  Upon creating an account and logging in, php sessions were created in the browser and the user would be able to rate the quotations on the front of the page.
